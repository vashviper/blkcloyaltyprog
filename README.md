## Smart Contract Details

Our Smart Loyalty Program is powered by a Solidity smart contract. Here, we delve into the technical aspects of the contract:
- **Owner Management:** The contract owner has the authority to manage the loyalty program. Only the owner can add rewards and control certain functions.
- **Customer Structure:** Within the contract, customer data is organized using a `Customer` struct, which includes information about their point balance and registration status.
- **Mappings:** We use mappings to store and manage customer data, rewards, and reward names. These include `customers`, `rewards`, and `rewardNames`.
- **Events:** Events are emitted to log significant actions, such as customer registration, points earned, points redeemed, and reward additions.
- **Modifiers:** The contract includes a modifier called `onlyOwner`, which ensures that specific functions can only be called by the contract owner.

Understanding these technical aspects is essential for both users and developers who want to engage with our Smart Loyalty Program. Now, let's move on to how users can interact with the smart contract.

## Interacting with the Smart Contract

To make the most of our Smart Loyalty Program, here's how you can interact with the Solidity smart contract:
- **Customer Registration:** Use the `register` function to register as a customer and start earning and redeeming points. Once registered, you can enjoy the benefits of the loyalty program.
- **Earning Points:** Customers can earn loyalty points by interacting with the program. If you're the contract owner, you can use the `earnPoints` function to add points to a customer's balance.
- **Checking Point Balance:** To keep track of your loyalty points, call the `checkBalance` function. It will provide you with your current point balance.
- **Redeeming Points:** When you're ready to enjoy the rewards, use the `redeemPoints` function to exchange your loyalty points for exciting incentives. Ensure you have enough points for the reward you want.
- **Adding Rewards (Owner Only):** If you're the contract owner, you have the privilege of adding new rewards. Utilize the `addReward` function to define new rewards and assign point values to them.

These functions provide the flexibility and power to fully engage with the Smart Loyalty Program.
